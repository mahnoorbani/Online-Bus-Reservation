**Bus reservation system**
this Online Bus Reservation System Project in PHP focuses mainly on reserving online bus tickets. 
To be more precise, the system helps to keep track of the bus schedule, and their management. Also, the system displays all the available buses.
. Evidently, this project contains an admin panel and a simple client-side.
 In an overview of this web application, the user can simply filter available bus schedules.
 If available, the user can reserve seats by providing details such as name and ticket quantity.

**Admin Panel**
An administrator has full control over the system. He/she can manage reservations, services, and so on. 
Here, each and every section has its own respective details such as name, and other important details. 
Here, an admin can list out a number of reservation records processed from the client-side. 
For reservation management, an admin can view each and every detail such as name, reference number, amount, destination, etc.
Here, the administrator can update reservations in order to update the ticket status of the customers

**Bus Schedule Management**
Moreover, the administrator can simply proceed with the management of the bus schedule after the completion of earlier stages. 
To be fair, this is the exact section that is shown on the client-side of the application.
